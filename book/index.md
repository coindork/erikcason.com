        <h1>CryptoSovereignty</h1>

        <p class="cs-sub">
          A brutal, lucid argument that sovereignty is not granted by institutions —
          it is engineered through cryptography, property, and voluntary coordination.

              Cryptosovereignty is a tour de force — a thought-provoking deep dive into the
              very essence of why Bitcoin is poised to usher in a complete paradigm shift
              as we move toward a future where solidarity and purpose reign supreme.

              I consider Cason’s book one of the most important works since the publication
              of the Cypherpunk Manifesto. Everyone who takes Bitcoin seriously should read it;
              those who don’t should read it twice.

              I remember first stumbling across Erik Cason’s work in 2019 and thinking,
              “How does nobody know about this guy?” I am so glad Erik Cason brought his
              writings together into a single book, and I hope you too will be blown away
              reading <em>Cryptosovereignty</em>.

        <p>
          A philosophy of Bitcoin as an emergent political order grounded in property,
