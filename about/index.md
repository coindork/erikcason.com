This is a personal thinking space first and foremost--I'll say what I want.
  <p>
    Erik Cason is a philosopher, entrepreneur, and systems thinker working at the
    intersection of cryptography, political philosophy, and economic coordination.
    His work focuses on how technologies—most notably Bitcoin—reshape sovereignty,
    legitimacy, property, and power in a world where trust is scarce and verification matters.
  </p>

  <p>
    He is best known for articulating <strong>cryptosovereignty</strong>: the idea that
    sovereignty is no longer primarily institutional or legal, but an emergent property
    of cryptographic systems. In this view, authority flows from individuals who can
    secure property, verify truth, and coordinate voluntarily. Bitcoin, for Cason, is
    not merely money, but a structural break in how political and economic order is formed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cason has worked within the Bitcoin industry at Coinbase and Unchained Capital,
    gaining firsthand experience with custody, security, and the operational limits
    of centralized systems. He is currently a co-founder of Vora.io, where he is building
    sovereign hardware and software systems designed to give individuals direct control
    over computation, data, and cryptographic keys—extending the logic of Bitcoin beyond
    money into personal computing and AI.
