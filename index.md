I write in public as a way of thinking.

This site is a personal philosophical terrain — a place for unfinished ideas, long-running inquiries, spoken work, and the occasional crystallization into essays, talks, or books.

# Bitcoin is the first non-violent exit from state power.

I write about money, violence, sovereignty, and the political implications of cryptographic systems.

My work treats Bitcoin not as a financial instrument, but as a civilizational rupture—one that separates property, law, and value from centralized political authority.

This site is a living archive of essays, notes, and long-form work exploring that rupture through philosophy, political theory, and technology.
